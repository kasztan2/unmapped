# The Unmapped Project

## Overview
This app allows you to find POIs belonging to retail chains that are **probably** not on OpenStreetMap yet.

Clone the repo, enter repo's directory and run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

To run only on data licensed under open licenses, run it with option `--open_license`.
